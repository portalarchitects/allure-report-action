# allure-report-action

This action generates Allure test reports. This action is a fork of [allure-report-branch-action](https://github.com/mgrybyk-org/allure-report-branch-action) that has been heavily modified to suite our needs at DryvIQ.

For an example of this action in use, refer to [this skysync-vnext GitHub Action workflow file](https://github.com/portalarchitects/skysync-vnext/blob/develop/.github/workflows/build-earthly.yaml).

The reports generated by this action are currently being [hosted here](https://potential-adventure-ozr3k39.pages.github.io/).
